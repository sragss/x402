Added Sign-In-With-X (SIWX) extension for wallet-based authentication. Clients can prove previous payment by signing a message, avoiding re-payment. Supports EVM and Solana signature schemes with multi-chain support, lifecycle hooks for servers and clients, and optional nonce tracking for replay protection.
