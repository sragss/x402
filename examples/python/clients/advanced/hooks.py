"""Payment lifecycle hooks example.

Demonstrates how to register hooks for payment creation lifecycle events.
Hooks allow you to add custom logic at different stages:
- on_before_payment_creation: Called before payment creation starts, can abort
- on_after_payment_creation: Called after successful payment creation
- on_payment_creation_failure: Called when payment creation fails, can recover

This is an advanced feature useful for:
- Logging payment events for debugging and monitoring
- Custom validation before allowing payments
- Error recovery strategies
- Metrics and analytics collection
